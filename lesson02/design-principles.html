            <p>Fritt's law deals with making things easily clikable or selectable for the user. In this case on Keychron's site 
                they have different options for keyboards for users to check out. There are big and selectable images that you can press 
                super easily especially in a mobile position. The images are easily reachable with your thumb making it easy to navigate 
                to those other keyboard pages.

            <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>

            <img src="images/white-space-example.jpg" alt="White Space Site Example">
            <p>On Quip's site you can see a clean simple design which matches the theme of their dental products. Which are also products 
                designed to be very clean and simple designs. They use white space well especially in the "Need help with your oral care routine?" 
                section. Simple text in the middle with enough space on the sides to give it breathing room.

            <p>I like the use of proximity used on the Motivosity page. You can see a whole section that groups 3 items with proximity 
                perfectly. You can tell which content belongs with each title. They even section it off with different colors to help us see 
                that the first group is stuff related with this blue item. And the title, paragraph, and icon are all grouped together.
